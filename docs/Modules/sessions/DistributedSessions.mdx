# Distributed Sessions with DAN

## Introduction

Biconomy’s Distributed Sessions are a powerful feature designed to enhance the efficiency, security, and user experience of decentralized applications. Leveraging Biconomy’s Delegated Authorisation Network (DAN), our distributed sessions solution provide a seamless way to manage authorization keys on MPC network and automate transactions securely, within given permissions context and efficiently. This product offers developers a zero-development, zero-custody sessions solution that can be easily integrated directly from the frontend.

## What is DAN?

The Delegated Authorisation Network (DAN) is Biconomy’s blockchain-agnostic programmable signing infrastructure, which leverages the economic security of Eigenlayer AVS. It is designed to enhance the security, customizability, and speed of managing authorization keys for smart accounts.

## Benefits of Distributed Sessions with DAN

**Enhanced Security:** Distributed sessions minimise the exposure of the private key by storing shards in the nodes and generating signature if certain conditions are met. In context of a session, they are ephemeral and even if a session key is compromised, the attacker gains limited access, protecting the user's main account and funds.

**Interoperable:** By storing private keys on the DAN network, even if the browser crashes or browser storage is compromised, users can still access their sessions.

**Automation and Efficiency:** Users can leave an intent, go to sleep and automated transactions will be processed in a secure way.
