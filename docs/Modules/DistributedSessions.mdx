# Distributed Sessions with DAN

## Introduction

Biconomy’s Distributed Sessions are a powerful feature designed to enhance the efficiency, security, and user experience of decentralized applications. Leveraging Biconomy’s Delegated Authorisation Network (DAN), our distributed sessions solution provide a seamless way to manage authorization keys and automate transactions securely and efficiently. This product offers developers a zero-development, zero-custody sessions solution that can be easily integrated directly from the frontend.

## What is DAN?

The Delegated Authorisation Network (DAN) is Biconomy’s off-chain authorization network, which leverages the economic security of Eigenlayer AVS. It is designed to enhance the security, customizability, and speed of managing authorization keys for smart accounts.

## Benefits of Distributed Sessions with DAN

**Enhanced Security:** Distributed sessions minimize the exposure of the main private key by using session keys with specific permissions. Even if a session key is compromised, the attacker gains limited access, protecting the user's main account and funds.

**Improved User Experience:** Users no longer need to confirm every single transaction. Instead, they can authorize a session key with predefined permissions for a specific period, allowing for smoother and more seamless interactions with dApps.

**Automation and Efficiency:** Distributed sessions enable the automation of repetitive or time-sensitive tasks. Users can set up session keys to handle recurring payments or interact with smart contracts automatically when certain conditions are met, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing operational efficiency.
